			  Another week, and another line-up of amazing music in Denver. Things kick off tonight with local legends The Fray at Red Rock. <a href="https://southwest.fm/DestinationRedRocks/">Free tickets</a> were going around. Did you get yours?<br><br>
			  Red Bull (yes the energy drink) is hosting two events that you should probably check out - Tuesday is <b>Blood Road</b> a Mountain Biking fil and Thursday is <b>Pomo</b>, a live electornic artist. Both shows are at the Bluebird and tickets are CHEAP.
			  Umphreyâ€™s McGee, Conor Oberst (previously your favorite emo singer/writer Bright Eyes), MisterWives, and Zeds Ded are all this week as well. How spoiled are we!?
			  <br><br>
			  Get after it Denver!
